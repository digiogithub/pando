# Tool usage policy
- When doing file search, prefer to use the Agent tool in order to reduce context usage.
- If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between the calls, make all of the independent calls in the same function_calls block.
- IMPORTANT: The user does not see the full output of the tool responses, so if you need the output of the tool for the response make sure to summarize it for the user.
